# MonkeyKong

## Introduction

MonkeyKong is a 2D puzzle platformer made using a custom 2D game engine (C++) and rendered using modern OpenGL.

The game engine architecture is built based on a Entity Component System (ECS). The renderer utilizes batch rendering for efficient rendering of in-game particles.
